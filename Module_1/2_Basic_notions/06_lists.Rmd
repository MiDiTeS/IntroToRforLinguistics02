# Introduction

In this tutorial we are going to discuss the one more basic data structure in **R**: lists. I left them to the end because they are the ones I use less frequently in my search. However, they might be important to some packages that use such data structure during their processing. 

# Lists

Lists are **R**'s Swiss knife for data storage and I like to think it as a "meta" data storage facility. In formal terms, a list is an object that can *contain* other objects inside it. The idea is it to serve as an inventory of data, regarding a project or a specific data analysis. 

Let us see it in practical terms. Firstly, Let us create a data frame:


```{r}
names <- c('Astolfo', "Eleutério", "Alarico", "Genésia","Gioconda","Ondina")
birthdays <-as.Date(c("1907-06-22","1987-07-12","1941-11-10",
                      "1940-11-15","1910-07-03","1982-06-21"))
gender <-c("male","male",'male', "female","female","female")
life.status <-c(FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE)
possible.age <-c(113,33, 79,80,110,38)
my.data.frame <-data.frame(names,birthdays,gender,life.status,possible.age)
colnames(my.data.frame) <-c("Names", 'Birthdays',"Gender","Life.Status",
                            "Possible.Age")
```


Secondly, we create a vector:

```{r}
my.vector <- c("b","r","a","s","i","l")
my.vector
```

Then a set of single variables:

```{r}
y <- 2.5
professor <- "Rodrigo"
```

And, finally a couple of matrices:

```{r}
columns.names <- c('col1','col2', 'col3')
rows.names <- c('row1','row2','row3','row4','row5')
My.Matrix <- matrix(c(1:15), nrow = 5, byrow = TRUE, dimnames = list(rows.names, columns.names))
columns.names <- c('col1','col2', 'col3')
rows.names <- c('row1','row2','row3','row4','row5')
My.Matrix2 <- matrix(c(15:29), nrow = 5, byrow = TRUE, dimnames = list(rows.names, columns.names))
```


Now let us make a list:

```{r}
My.list <- list(my.vector,My.Matrix,My.Matrix2,professor,y,my.data.frame)
My.list
```

As we print `my.list` in the console or use the data viewer to have a pic on it, we will see that our data represented as an element of such a list. As any other data we can access, rename, and extract from a list. 

## Remaning list elements

Our first strategy is to associate a vector to the list's elements, as we do in any other data format:

```{r}
names(My.list) <- c('my.vector','My.Matrix','My.Matrix2','professor','y','my.data.frame')
My.list
```

## Deleting elements in a list

Simple, we delete it as a column in a data frame:
```{r}
My.list[6]<-NULL
My.list
```

## Extracting elements from a list. 

We can pull an element and send it to another variable:

```{r}
My.Matrix3<-My.list[["My.Matrix2"]]
My.Matrix3
```

Note that it does not delete the data inside the list, only copies it to a new variable.
