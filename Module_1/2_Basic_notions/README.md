# Basic Notions

Here we are going to discuss some of the basic notions of R, mostly in order to understand some of the main issues regarding basic syntax and the  IDEs.

- *.R files are R scripts, you can run them in your IDE
- *.Rmd files are Rmarkdown files, they might be open in your IDE off-line

Note that in each file there is an assignment that must be completed.
