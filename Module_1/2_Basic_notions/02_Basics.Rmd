# Introduction
In this tutorial we will try to do get some introductory concepts on R language, mostly getting some basic conventions. 

# Some very basic stuff

R is a good arithmetic tool. If we type the following lines in our script and run each at a time:


```{r}
1+5

5-4

100/33

5^2

5**2

9/4

9*4

(300 * 9) + (500 / 2)

x <- 2L
x
typeof(x)

y <- 2.5
y
typeof(y)

z <- 3+2i
z
typeof(z)

h <- "h"
typeof(h)
h

q1 <- TRUE
typeof(q1)
q1

q2 <- FALSE
q2
typeof(q2)

a <- seq(0,100, 2)
a
typeof(a)

repetition <- rep("repetition",100)
repetition

typeof(repetition)
```


# In a nutshell

These commands taught us a couple of things:

1. R can make some basic calculations
1. R can store values in its memory
  - But be aware that data is not saved until you tell R to do so
1. We use "<-" for variable attribution
  - "=" is also possible, but "<-" is a better choice because
    1. "=" is already present inside some commands, so "<-" is exclusive of variable attribution
    1. "<-" brings us some direction regarding the attribution
1. There are some kinds of data in R, the basic ones are:
  - **Integer**: whole numbers, without decimals
  - **Double**: numbers with decimals
  - **Complex**: numbers with scientific notation
  - **Character**: words or letters
  - **Logical** (or Boolean): meaning *TRUE* or *FALSE*
  - **Dates**: numbers representing dates
  - **Vector**: ordered sequence of numbers or characters
1. Commands in R are always a sequence of letters followed by "()" like `seq()`
1. The way to tell R a value ought to be understood as a  character is to write between quotations marks 
1. Each command might get a set of arguments
