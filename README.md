This is the ongoing first try of a R course applied to language studies. Please feel free to help in the codes and tutorial improvement. If you see any mistake or possibility of code rewriting, please let me know. 

Initially, it was thought as a set of lessons to my graduate students at [IEL](http://www.iel.unicamp.br)/[UNICAMP](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/). However, the possibility of further discussion with fellow researchers drove me to let it open to the community. So, if you are not a MA student or a PhD student/candidate under my supervision, you might skip the first module. 

## What it is going to cover

This module is going to cover some tools for corpus and discourse analysis using **R**'s language and packages. It is not intended to be a very advanced set of tutorials, since it is mostly introducing the tools for the community. 

## Modules

These modules are under construction, so some themes or tutorials might change during this semester. But in a nutshell, it intends to cover:

1. Tools for course
     * This set of tutorials brings the tools needed for my class on its online version.
1. First steps
     * Basic lessons for understanding R and its integration with GUIs
1. Data analysis projects
     * Some hands-on projects on linguistic data analysis, including:
        * Data organisation and processing
        * Data scraping from websites and social media. 
        
# Assignments

In the assignment section, you will find a set of tasks to be performed. Such tasks validate our course. There is at least one task for each module; in some cases, there might be more. 

### Please note that

- It is not a progressive set of tutorials. It starts on the basics, but then it becomes more problem-oriented. So sometimes basic and more intermediate elements of code are bought together. 
- Some packages will need to be installed during the analysis. So make sure you have the appropriate system permission.
- The course is mostly directed to language data, but other areas might benefit from it. 
- The assignments are mandatory.
